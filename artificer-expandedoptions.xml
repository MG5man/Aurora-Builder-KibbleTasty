            <p>A Cursesmith's power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they've made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be Lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Artificers by seizing power that others dare not wield. You forge a melee weapon into a potent artifact. The weapon can be used as a weapon in its dormant state as a normal weapon, or stirred to life showing its true power as a bonus action. Select one of the following when you create the weapon as its awakened power:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="indent"><strong><em>Abhorrent Nature.</em></strong> The weapon twists and writhes with unnatural life; you can select the Abhorrent Mutation Upgrade twice for free, and a third time at 11th level. Your weapon can benefit from multiple mutations.</p></li>
                <li><p class="indent"><strong><em>Destructive Power.</em></strong> The weapon hums with dangerous destructive power. Each time you deal damage with it, it deals additional damage equal to your Curse Die. The damage of the Curse Die is maximized when attacking objects or structures.</p></li>
                <li><p class="indent"><strong><em>Necrotic Wounding.</em></strong> The weapon inflicts necrotic rot on hit. This does not require concentration, but can only afflict one target at a time. The weapon deals necrotic damage while awakened.</p></li>
                <li><p class="indent"><strong><em>Eldritch Eruption.</em></strong> At the time of creation, select a evocation cantrip from the Wizard spell list with a spell attack roll. Attacks with this weapon can be replaced by spell attacks of that cantrip. Once per turn, you can add your Intelligence modifier to damage dealt.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Curse.</strong> You gain a <strong>Curse Die</strong>. Your Curse Die is a d4. At level 11, your cursed die becomes a d6. Regardless of the power selected, when you make an attack roll with the weapon using its awakened power, roll a curse die and subtract it from the result.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once awakened, the weapon can be surpressed back to it's dormant state as a bonus action; if it has been awakened for a number of turns less than your proficiency modifier, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw to cause it to return to it's dormant state.</p>

You cannot attack other creatures while grappling a creature with this weapon. If you have the Life mutation from this upgrade, you can make an Intelligence (Athletics) check to initiate or contest the grapple.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Reach.</em></strong> It stretches and flexes unnaturally in seeking its targets. It gains the reach property.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Split.</em></strong> It splits into multiple writhing branches. They batter a creature when attacking; if the weapon's damage die is a d8 or higher the weapon has its damage dice size halved, but number doubled (for example, from a 1d8 to 2d4). If the weapon die is a d6 already, it is reduced to a d4 and it gains only one additional damage die (for example from 2d6 to 3d4). It cannot reduce dice below d4. It can attack other creatures even while grappling or restraining a creature with the Grip mutation from this upgrade, but loses one damage die for each creature it is grappling or restraining.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A Runesmith is an Artificer that has narrowed their focus to working a specific language of magic - powerful Runes that can channel long lasting power. These Runes come in many shapes and forms, the lore behind from many sources.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Runesmith can be a knight, his runes splashed with gleaming power across his armor, or a scholar lending their power to the companions, marking potent runes on their weapons before standing back, or even a strange tatooed mystic, their runes tattooed across their very body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Runesmiths are not inherently good or evil, though their rigorous attention to detail and patience tend to make them more inclined to a Lawful perspective.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you can mark magical runes, imbuing the things they are marked onto with magic. A rune can be marked on a weapon, piece of armor, or directly onto yourself, as a type of runic tattoo. Each rune grants a passive ability based on what is marked on that enhances the ability of what it is marked on, and has an active ability that can be activated as an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action while it is marked.</p>
            <p class="indent">Only a single rune can be marked on a piece of armor or a weapon, though you can mark multiple runes on yourself. The affected creature of a rune is the creature wielding the weapon or armor it is marked on, or you if the rune is directly marked on you.</p>
            <p class="indent">When using a rune on yourself, you gain both the weapon effect (applied to your unarmed strikes and natural weapons) and the armor effect (as if you were wearing armor marked with that rune).</p>
            <p class="indent">You know the following runes, and can learn more from upgrades. You can mark your runes during a long rest, and can have two runes marked at a time, gaining the ability to have an additional rune marked at 3rd level (to three runes), 5th level (to four runes), and 14th level (to five runes). These last until you mark a new rune, with the oldest rune fading when you mark a new one after reaching your maximum number of runes. Upgrades that grant a new Runes does not increase this number, just expands the range of Runes you can mark.</p>

Anything grappling, restraining, or otherwise holding onto you within 5 feet takes Fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can end this at the start of your turn (no action required). Whenever you end your turn with this active, you take 1 fire damage that cannot be resisted.
            You can fully ignite your armor and cast fire shield without consuming a spell slot. When cast with this upgrade, you can only select the fire damage option. Once you cast it in this way, you cannot cast it again until you complete a long rest.</description>
