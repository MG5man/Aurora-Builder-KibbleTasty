            <p>A Cursesmith's power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they've made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be Lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You partake a dark ritual investing enormous power into an melee weapon and intertwining it with your very soul, bestowing it with great power, but twisting and corrupting it. The weapon becomes permenantly bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you perform the rite, you instill one of the following awakening powers into the artifact: Empowered, Living, Necrotic, or Eldritch (listed below).</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can awaken the weapon, invoking the awakened power and the cursed property until you suppress it again. You can suppress it as a bonus action, but if it has been awakened for more than 1 minute, you must pass a DC 10 Charisma save to return its dormant state.</p>
            <h5>EMPOWERED</h5>
            <p>When awakened, the weapon hums with great power, dealing additional 1d4 damage of the weapons damage type. The extra d4 is maximized when attacking objects or structures.</p>
            <h5>LIVING</h5>
            <p>When awakened, your weapon morphes into a writhing living form. Select two of Abhorrent Life, Grip, Reach, or Split. It gains these properties while awakened.</p>
            <h5>NECROTIC</h5>
            <p>When awakened, the weapon is enshrouded in dark energy. Each time you hit a creature with it, it inflicts a stack of necrotic rot on the creature. At the end of a creature's turn it takes a 1d4 damage per stack of necrotic rot on it and makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the stacks on removed. On a failure, they remain. You can have a maximum number of stacks on a creature equal to your proficiency modifier.</p>
            <h5>ELDRITCH</h5>
            <p>When awakened, it glows with magical power. When awakened, you can release magical blasts of power from the weapon that deal damage equal to the weapons damage dice. Select from cold, fight, lightning or necrotic for its damage type. In place of making an attack with this weapon, you can release this energy as a ranged spell attack. The ranged spell attack has a range of 120 feet. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to damage done with this attack.</p>

You can a select the condition in which your weapon can be destroyed. Your weapon can no longer be permanently destroyed by any other means. This means can be absurd or implausible, but must be something potentially possible.</description>

            <p>A Runesmith is an Inventor that has narrowed their focus to working a specific language of magic - powerful Runes that can channel long lasting power. These Runes come in many shapes and forms, the lore behind from many sources.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Runesmith can be a knight, his runes splashed with gleaming power across his armor, or a scholar lending their power to the companions, marking potent runes on their weapons before standing back, or even a strange tatooed mystic, their runes tattooed across their very body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Runesmiths are not inherently good or evil, though their rigorous attention to detail and patience tend to make them more inclined to a Lawful perspective.</p>
